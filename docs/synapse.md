# Synapse submissions

Submission to LRGASP is managing by [SAGE Synapse](https://www.synapse.org) system. 
Synapse is used to control access for participant submission, allowing data to be shared
only with the LGRASP evaluators.  The Synapse evaluation results report facility is not 
used.

Note that the use of the term "challenge" has different meaning for Synapse and
LRGASP.  LRGASP as a whole is a Synapse challenge.  Each LRGASP challenge is 
a Synapse sub-challenge, represented by a Synapse evaluation queue.

## Configuring your Synapse accounts

1. All individuals in the lab that will be using Synapse to submit 
   must create an account pass the easy certification as described in
   [Getting Started with Synapse](https://docs.synapse.org/articles/getting_started.html).
2. The lab should create a [Synapse team](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Teams.1985446029.html) (e.g. "Darwin LRGASP Team").
3  Participating Lab members should join these teams:
    * the lab team ("Darwin LRGASP Team")
    * "LRGASP Participants"
4. Create an Synapse project (e.g. "Darwin LRGASP Project") that will be use
   to contain uploaded entries before submission to an LRGASP evaluation
   queue.
5. Set project sharing for the lab project ("Darwin LRGASP Project") to include:
    * the lab team ("Darwin LRGASP Team") to `Can edit & delete`
    * "LRGASP Evaluators" to `Can download`

## Submitting LRGASP challenge entries

Two commands are provide to assist in submitting entries to LRGASP via
Synapse.  This is a two-step process of uploading an entry and then submitting
it for evaluation.




A LRGASP challenge entry is submitted to an evaluation for the LRGASP
challenge.  In Synapse terminology, all of LRGASP is a challenge and each of
the LRGASP challenges is an evaluation queue (also called a sub-challenge).
