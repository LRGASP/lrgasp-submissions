* test for compressed data files
* expression matrix validator
* data required:
** list of challenges
** genomes:
- list of sequences and sizes
** list of BAMs
** annotations
* capturing command lines
* require protocol description
* add assembly
* doc that file paths are relative
* add additional file types
* how to tie together experiments to be evaluated
- call an *entry*
* should expression matrix have transcript_id instead of ID?
* expression matrix:
