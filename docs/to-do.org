* metadata validator
* test for compressed data files
* expression matrix validator
* data required:
** list of challenges
** genomes:
- list of sequences and sizes
** list of BAMs
** annotations
* capturing command lines
* require protocol description
* add assembly
* doc that file paths are relative
* add additional file types
* how to tie together experiments to be evaluated
- call an *entry*
* should expression matrix have transcript_id instead of ID?
* expression matrix:
https://github.com/LRGASP/lrgasp-submissions/issues/11
allow '*'
validate
* removed 
examples/our_entry/exp_try/experiment.json:2:    "team_id": "experts",

* problem: {exp}ression and {expr}iment are easily confused
- rename exp to quant ? or express,
- experiment -> analysis  (consistent with ENA)
  exr -> express, quant
  mod -> model
- want to distinguish model from expression
  model_
  quant_
- validate experiment ids, allow `-'
