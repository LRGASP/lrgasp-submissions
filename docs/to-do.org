* require protocol description
* add assembly
* doc that file paths are relative
* add additional file types
* how to tie together experiments to be evaluated
- call an *entry*
* should expression matrix have transcript_id instead of ID?
* expression matrix:
https://github.com/LRGASP/lrgasp-submissions/issues/11
allow '*'
validate
* example mixes quant and model experirements
* validate same type of experiments
* drop model_/quant_ prefix requirements
* require specific the data file names
* require included model_gtf in quant.
* experiment_type is deduced from challange id
challange_id can be obtained from entry_id (add to experiment)
