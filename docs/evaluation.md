# Self-evaluation tools

LRGASP provides the evaluation tools that are going to be used by the project
so that participants can run self-evaluation.  While we may update the
evaluation software or add new tools to answer questions that arise during the
evaluation, running these tools will help participants understand how their
entries are performing.

Please see the README files associate with each of the packages for
documentation on running the tools.
