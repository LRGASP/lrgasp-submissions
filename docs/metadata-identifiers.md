# Types of identifiers
## Symbolic identifiers

Various components of the submission system have symbolic identifiers.  These identifiers consist of [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) upper- and lower-case alphabetic characters, numbers, and underscores.  They must not begin with numbers.  In some cases, specific prefixes are required.

## Feature and read identifiers

Feature identifiers (transcripts and genes) and read identifiers may contain any combination of printing, non-whitespace characters [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).  This requirement is more restrictive than allowed by GTF.

## Synapse identifiers
Identifiers assigned by Synapse are in the form ```sny123456``.
